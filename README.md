Hi
##qvarcopm
In **qvarcomp.r** and **qvarcmop1.r** you can find my ideas of comparison two distributions by their variations. 
In formula 

*qvarcomp(datax, datay, nq)* 

you need just to define data sets - X and Y and number of quantiles (nq) you want to separate the
distributions of X and Y.
There are two files with the same formula: in qvarcomp.R you can find only distribution to distribution (D2D) analysis; 
In **qvarcomp1.R** you can find extention of the analysis with comperison to teoretical (normal in this case) distributions.
